## üîß Troubleshooting

### Issue: Voicemail not recording

**Check**:
1. Twilio webhook logs: https://console.twilio.com/monitor/debugger
2. Render logs: Look for "Voicemail recording completed"
3. Verify webhook URL is publicly accessible

### Issue: No Claude AI summary (using fallback)

**Symptoms**: Messages show: `Voicemail from +1234567890: [raw transcription]`

**Fix**:
1. Verify `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set in environment
2. Check logs for: `‚ö†Ô∏è ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not configured`
3. Restart service after adding key

### Issue: Credits not deducting

**Check**:
1. Twilio statusCallback configuration
2. Logs for: `‚úÖ Tracked call CAxxxx: X seconds for client Y`
3. Database: `SELECT * FROM usage_records`

### Issue: SMS reply button not working

**Mobile Only**: This feature requires a mobile device with SMS capability
**Desktop**: Button will not work (SMS URIs only work on mobile)
