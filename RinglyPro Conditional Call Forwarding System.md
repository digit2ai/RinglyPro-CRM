RinglyPro Conditional Call Forwarding System - Development Handoff
Project Overview
System: Multi-tenant SaaS voice AI CRM with Rachel assistant
Goal: Enable clients to control when business calls forward to Rachel AI vs ring directly
Approach: Leverage carrier conditional forwarding codes + backend API + mobile UI toggle

‚úÖ Completed Today - Backend Infrastructure
1. Multi-Tenant Client Management API
File: src/routes/client.js

GET /api/client/rachel-status/:client_id - Get any client's Rachel configuration
GET /api/client/list - List all clients in system
Uses raw SQL queries (no model import issues)
Fully multi-tenant, no hard-coded client data

2. Comprehensive Carrier Forwarding System
File: src/routes/callForwarding.js

GET /api/call-forwarding/carriers - Returns 9 major US carriers
GET /api/call-forwarding/setup/:carrier/:client_id - Generates carrier-specific codes
Supported Carriers: AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Sprint, US Cellular, Boost, Metro, Visible, Cricket
Code Generation: Automatic replacement of {rachel_number} with client's RinglyPro number

3. Updated Application Architecture
File: src/app.js

Properly mounted new route endpoints
Fixed middleware order (critical for Express)
Added health check status for call forwarding features
Maintained existing Rachel voice booking functionality


üß™ Testing Results - All Systems Operational
Local Development Testing
bash# Carrier list - 9 carriers supported
curl http://localhost:3000/api/call-forwarding/carriers
‚úÖ Returns: AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, Sprint, US Cellular, Boost, Metro, Visible, Cricket

# Client-specific forwarding codes
curl http://localhost:3000/api/call-forwarding/setup/att/5
‚úÖ Returns: Manuel's business (Digit2ai) with AT&T codes: *21*+18886103810#

Database Validation
Multi-tenant structure confirmed:

Client 1: Default Business (+1-555-DEFAULT)
Client 3: Test Client 2 Business (+15555552222)
Client 5: Digit2ai (+16566001400) - Manuel's business
Client 7: RinglyPro (+18886103810)


üìä Database Architecture Status
Key Tables for Forwarding System
sql-- Clients table (existing) - Core tenant data
clients.id, business_name, business_phone, ringlypro_number, rachel_enabled

-- Appointments table (existing) - Rachel bookings  
appointments.client_id, customer_name, customer_phone, appointment_date

-- Calls table (existing) - Usage tracking
calls.client_id, from_number, to_number, duration, status

-- Need to Add: Forwarding tracking tables
forwarding_logs (client_id, action, carrier, activation_code, created_at)
Database Migration Required
sql-- Add forwarding status fields to clients table
ALTER TABLE clients ADD COLUMN forwarding_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
ALTER TABLE clients ADD COLUMN forwarding_carrier VARCHAR(50);
ALTER TABLE clients ADD COLUMN forwarding_activated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE;

üèóÔ∏è System Architecture - How It Works
Call Flow with Conditional Forwarding

Client Setup: Business owner dials carrier code from their business phone

AT&T: *21*+18886103810#
Verizon: *71+18886103810
T-Mobile: **004*+18886103810*11#


Prospect Calls Business: 656-600-1400 rings normally for 3-4 rings
Automatic Forward: Carrier forwards unanswered calls to Rachel (+18886103810)
Rachel Processing: Existing system handles appointment booking with client identification

API Integration Points

Mobile CRM ‚Üí /api/call-forwarding/setup/att/5 ‚Üí Display Codes
Client Action ‚Üí Dial Code ‚Üí Carrier Network ‚Üí Rachel Forward Active
Toggle Off ‚Üí Dial Deactivation Code ‚Üí Forward Disabled


üéØ Next Phase - Mobile CRM Interface
Required UI Components
1. Rachel Configuration Screen
Settings ‚Üí Rachel Configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Rachel Toggle (existing)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Call Forwarding Section (NEW)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Toggle Switch: "Forward Calls to Rachel"
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Carrier Selection Dropdown
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Setup Instructions Display
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Quick Dial Button
2. Forwarding Setup Flow
When Toggle ON:

Detect/ask carrier (dropdown: AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile...)
Call: GET /api/call-forwarding/setup/{carrier}/{client_id}
Display activation code with copy/dial functionality
Show step-by-step instructions
Mark as "Pending Setup" until confirmed

When Toggle OFF:

Display deactivation code
Show instructions to turn off forwarding
Update status to "Disabled"

3. Status Tracking Interface

Active: "üìû Calls forwarding to Rachel after 3 rings"
Pending: "‚è≥ Dial activation code to complete setup"
Inactive: "üì± Calls ring your business phone directly"

Technical Requirements

Frontend: React Native/Flutter mobile app
State Management: Track forwarding status per client
Deep Linking: "Dial Now" button opens phone dialer with pre-filled code
Persistence: Save carrier preference and setup status
Error Handling: Handle invalid carriers, API failures


üìã Implementation Priority
Phase 1: Mobile UI Components (Next)

Create forwarding configuration screen
Add carrier selection dropdown
Implement toggle switch with API integration
Build code display with copy/dial functionality

Phase 2: Enhanced Features

Add forwarding status tracking to database
Build automated testing flow
Create admin panel for carrier code management
Add usage analytics for forwarding adoption

Phase 3: Production Deployment

Deploy backend changes to production
Update mobile app with new UI
Create user onboarding flow
Monitor forwarding success rates


üîß Technical Notes
Environment Variables Needed
bash# Existing (already configured)
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=xxx
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=xxx
DATABASE_URL=xxx

# No additional env vars needed for forwarding
API Authentication

Current endpoints use client_id parameter (testing mode)
Production should add proper JWT authentication
Mobile app needs authenticated user ‚Üí client mapping

Error Handling Patterns

Invalid carrier: Return supported carriers list
Client not found: 404 with clear message
Database errors: 500 with error details (dev mode only)
