# Advanced GoHighLevel Features Implementation Plan

## ‚úÖ Implementation Status

**Phase 1 Complete!** All backend-ready features now have NLP handlers.

**What's Working:**
- ‚úÖ Appointment booking with natural language dates

- ‚úÖ Review requests via SMS/Email
- ‚úÖ Social media scheduling (Facebook/Instagram)

**API Limitations:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Pipeline creation/editing - NOT supported by GHL API v2 (only GET)
- Users have requested POST endpoints on GHL feature board

## üéØ Features to Implement

### 1. **Appointment Booking** ‚úÖ Backend Ready

## üìã Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Enable All Backend-Ready Features (TODAY)
1. Add NLP handlers for:
   - Appointment booking with calendar selection
   - Task creation with due dates
   - Workflow list and enrollment
   - Campaign enrollment
   - Opportunity stage updates

2. Improve natural language understanding:
   - Date/time parsing ("tomorrow at 2pm", "next Friday")
   - Duration parsing ("30 minutes", "1 hour")
   - Smart calendar selection

3. Add success confirmations and helpful responses

### Phase 2: Add Missing Backend Functions
1. Pipeline creation/management APIs
2. Review request system
3. Social media posting (if available in GHL API)

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Bulk operations (add multiple contacts to workflow)
2. Conditional logic ("if contact has tag VIP, add to premium workflow")
3. Scheduled tasks ("send review request 3 days after purchase")

## üöÄ Quick Win Features (Implement First)

These are already in the backend and just need NLP:

1. **List Workflows**
   - API: `GET /workflows/`
   - NLP: "show workflows", "list workflows"

2. **Create Appointment**
   - API: `POST /calendars/events/appointments`
   - NLP: "book appointment for john@test.com on Friday at 3pm"

3. **Update Opportunity Stage**
   - API: `PUT /opportunities/{id}` with `stageId`
   - NLP: "move opportunity XYZ to Closed Won"

4. **List Campaigns**
   - API: `GET /campaigns/`
   - NLP: "show campaigns", "list campaigns"

## üìù NLP Patterns to Add

```javascript
// Appointments
"book appointment for {contact} {date} at {time}"
"schedule appointment with {contact} tomorrow"
"create appointment for {email} on {date}"

// Tasks with Due Dates
"create task for {contact}: {description} due {date}"
"remind me to {action} for {contact} on {date}"
"set reminder for {contact} {date}: {message}"

// Workflows
"show workflows"
"add {contact} to {workflow} workflow"
"enroll {contact} in workflow {workflowId}"
"remove {contact} from {workflow}"

// Campaigns
"list campaigns"
"add {contact} to {campaign} campaign"
"enroll {contact} in campaign {campaignId}"

// Opportunities
"move opportunity {id} to {stage}"
"update opportunity {id} value {amount}"
"change opportunity {id} status to won"

// Reviews
"send review request to {contact}"
"request review from {email}"
"ask {contact} for review"

// Pipelines
"create pipeline {name} with stages {stage1}, {stage2}"
"show pipelines"
"update pipeline {id} add stage {stageName}"
```

## ‚ö° Starting Implementation NOW

I'll implement Phase 1 features immediately with proper NLP handlers.
