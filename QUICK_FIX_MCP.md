# MCP Server Issue - Quick Fix

## Problem
The official GoHighLevel MCP server at `https://services.leadconnectorhq.com/mcp/` appears to not be publicly accessible yet, causing search failures in the MCP Copilot.

## Current Status
- ❌ Official MCP server calls failing
- ✅ REST API working perfectly
- ✅ Direct API routes (`/api/ghl/*`) working

## Quick Solution

The code is already set up with automatic fallback from MCP to REST API. However, the fallback might not be triggering correctly. Let me verify the MCP server is accessible:

### Test MCP Server Directly
```bash
curl -X POST https://services.leadconnectorhq.com/mcp/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer pit-acf324ce-7568-4d2c-adbc-6f225fc49cfe" \
  -H "locationId: YOUR_LOCATION_ID" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "tool": "contacts_get-contacts",
    "input": {"query": "test", "limit": 10}
  }'
```

If this returns an error, the MCP server isn't available yet.

## Options

### Option 1: Wait for GHL MCP Server
The official MCP server might be in beta or require special access. Contact GoHighLevel support to get access.

### Option 2: Use REST API (Recommended for Now)
The REST API is proven, tested, and works perfectly. All the same functionality is available.

### Option 3: Use Direct API Routes
Instead of the MCP Copilot UI, use the direct API routes at `/api/ghl/*` which work perfectly.

## What's Working Right Now

✅ **Direct API Routes:** `https://ringlypro-crm.onrender.com/api/ghl/*`
- All contacts operations
- SMS/Email sending
- Notes, tasks, appointments
- Opportunities, pipelines
- AI composite actions

## Recommended Next Step

Since the MCP Copilot is having issues with the official MCP server, I recommend:

1. Verify your GoHighLevel account has MCP server access enabled
2. Contact GHL support if needed
3. Use the direct API routes in the meantime (they work perfectly!)

Would you like me to:
A) Create a test to verify MCP server accessibility
B) Temporarily disable MCP and use only REST API (guaranteed to work)
C) Both

Let me know and I'll implement the fix immediately!
