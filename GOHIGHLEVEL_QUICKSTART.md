# GoHighLevel Integration - Quick Start Guide

## What You Have Now

Your RinglyPro CRM now has a complete GoHighLevel MCP integration that allows your AI assistant to interact with your GHL CRM automatically!

## Next Steps to Get Started

### 1. Find Your GoHighLevel Location ID

You need to add your Location ID to complete the setup. Here's how:

1. Log into your GoHighLevel account
2. Go to **Settings** â†’ **Company**
3. Look for your **Location ID** (it's usually a long alphanumeric string)
4. Copy this ID

### 2. Configure Environment Variables on Render

1. Go to your Render dashboard: https://dashboard.render.com/
2. Find your **RinglyPro-CRM** service
3. Click on it, then go to **Environment**
4. Add these two environment variables:
   ```
   GHL_PRIVATE_API_KEY=pit-acf324ce-7568-4d2c-adbc-6f225fc49cfe
   GHL_LOCATION_ID=YOUR_LOCATION_ID_HERE
   ```
5. Click **Save Changes** - this will trigger an automatic redeploy

### 3. Wait for Deployment (2-3 minutes)

Your app will automatically redeploy with the new configuration. You can watch the deployment logs in Render.

### 4. Test the Integration

Once deployed, test the health endpoint:

```bash
curl https://ringlypro-crm.onrender.com/api/ghl/health
```

You should see:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "service": "GoHighLevel MCP Integration",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T..."
}
```

### 5. Test Creating a Contact

```bash
curl -X POST https://ringlypro-crm.onrender.com/api/ghl/contacts/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "firstName": "Test",
    "lastName": "Contact",
    "phone": "+18135559999",
    "email": "test@example.com"
  }'
```

**Note:** Authentication is handled via environment variables, so you don't need to pass API keys in the request headers when testing from your backend.

### 6. Use the AI Welcome Action

This is the coolest feature - it creates a contact, sends them a welcome SMS, and logs a note all in one call:

```bash
curl -X POST https://ringlypro-crm.onrender.com/api/ghl/ai/welcome-contact \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "phone": "+18135559123",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "welcomeMessage": "Hi John! Welcome to our service. Looking forward to working with you!"
  }'
```

## Example Use Cases for Your AI Assistant

### Scenario 1: "Add a new lead and send them a message"
**User says:** "Add John Doe with phone 813-555-9123 and send him an intro SMS"

**Your AI calls:**
```
POST /api/ghl/ai/welcome-contact
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "phone": "+18135559123",
  "welcomeMessage": "Hi John! Thanks for reaching out..."
}
```

### Scenario 2: "Log this conversation and create a follow-up"
**User says:** "Log that I spoke with John about pricing, follow up next week"

**Your AI calls:**
```
POST /api/ghl/ai/log-conversation
{
  "contactId": "contact_abc123",
  "conversationSummary": "Discussed pricing options. Customer interested in premium package.",
  "followUpTask": "Call back to discuss pricing",
  "dueDate": "2025-01-27T10:00:00Z"
}
```

### Scenario 3: "Send a message to a contact"
**User says:** "Send John a text saying the quote is ready"

**Your AI calls:**
```
POST /api/ghl/conversations/messages/sms
{
  "contactId": "contact_abc123",
  "message": "Hi John! Your quote is ready. Let me know when you'd like to review it."
}
```
