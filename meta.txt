Hello Meta Support Team,

My ad account (ID: 52632987) was recently disabled for “unusual activity.” 
This appears to be an automatic flag. I manage ads for RinglyPro / Digit2Ai, 
a legitimate small business that promotes an AI productivity tool for professionals. 

All of our ads comply with Meta’s Advertising Policies and do not involve 
misleading content, policy violations, or restricted products. 

Please review and reinstate my ad account as soon as possible so I can continue 
running compliant business campaigns. If any verification or documentation is needed, 
I’ll be happy to provide it immediately.

Thank you very much for your help.
