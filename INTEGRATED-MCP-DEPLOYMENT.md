```

### View Logs in Render:

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### MCP routes not loading?
Check logs for:
```
✅ MCP integration routes loaded successfully
🤖 MCP AI Copilot routes mounted at /api/mcp
```

If you see:
```
⚠️ MCP integration routes not available
```

Then check that `src/routes/mcp.js` exists and has proper dependencies.

### Web UI not accessible?
1. Verify `public/mcp-copilot/` directory exists
2. Check that static files are being served
3. Try: `https://your-service.onrender.com/mcp-copilot/index.html`

### API connection errors?
1. Verify environment variables are set
2. Check API credentials are correct
3. Test health endpoint first
