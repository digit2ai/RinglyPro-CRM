# 🚀 START HERE - Next Session

**Date:** October 5, 2025
**Status:** Session persistence fixes deployed, waiting for Render to go live
**Action:** Test appointment booking after deployment completes

---

## ✅ WHAT WAS FIXED (Just Deployed):

1. **DTMF Timeout:** Reduced from 10s to 3s - should fix double-press issue
2. **Appointment Booking Routes:** Added GET handlers for redirect compatibility
3. **Session Persistence:** Added explicit session.save() calls before redirects in name/phone collection

**Deployment Status:** Pushed to GitHub, Render auto-deploying now (2-3 min)

**Root Cause Found:** The appointment booking was failing because session data (prospect_name, prospect_phone) wasn't being saved before the redirect. When the next endpoint was called, the session data was lost.

## 🔍 IF STILL NOT WORKING:

Check Render logs at: https://dashboard.render.com/

Look for:
- `✅ Using Rachel's premium voice` - Good
- `📝 Name collected` - Good
- `📞 Phone collected` - Should see this
- `📅 Booking appointment` - Should see this

**Common issues:**
- Session not persisting → Check session middleware
- Timeout too short → Increase speechTimeout in gather
- Wrong redirect → Check TwiML structure

---

## 📊 SYSTEM STATUS:

**Working:**
- ✅ Bilingual greeting
- ✅ Language selection (after fix)
- ✅ Rachel/Lina voices
- ✅ Speech recognition
- ✅ Name collection

**To Verify:**
- ❓ Phone number collection
- ❓ Appointment booking completion
