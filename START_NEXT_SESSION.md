## 🔍 IF STILL NOT WORKING:

Check Render logs at: https://dashboard.render.com/

Look for:
- `✅ Using Rachel's premium voice` - Good
- `📝 Name collected` - Good
- `📞 Phone collected` - Should see this
- `📅 Booking appointment` - Should see this

**Common issues:**
- Session not persisting → Check session middleware
- Timeout too short → Increase speechTimeout in gather
- Wrong redirect → Check TwiML structure

---

## 📊 SYSTEM STATUS:

**Working:**
- ✅ Bilingual greeting
- ✅ Language selection (after fix)
- ✅ Rachel/Lina voices
- ✅ Speech recognition
- ✅ Name collection

**To Verify:**
- ❓ Phone number collection
- ❓ Appointment booking completion

## 📞 QUICK COMMANDS:
