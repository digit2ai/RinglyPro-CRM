# URGENT LOGIN FIX

## Problem
Login is failing because the database doesn't have the new CRM columns yet (`ghl_api_key`, `ghl_location_id`).

## Solution
Run the migration immediately on Render:

```bash
npm run migrate:crm-integration
```

## How to Run Migration on Render

1. Go to Render Dashboard: https://dashboard.render.com
2. Select your service: `ringlypro-crm`
3. Click "Shell" tab
4. Run the command:
   ```bash
   npm run migrate:crm-integration
   ```

## Expected Output
```
ðŸ”„ Adding GoHighLevel integration fields to clients table...
âœ… Added ghl_api_key column
âœ… Added ghl_location_id column
âœ… GoHighLevel integration fields migration completed successfully
```

## After Migration
- Login will work immediately
- Settings page will show CRM Integrations tab
- MCP Copilot will be able to auto-load credentials

## Alternative: Run Migration via SQL

If npm command doesn't work, run this SQL directly in Render PostgreSQL:

```sql
ALTER TABLE clients
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS ghl_api_key VARCHAR(255),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS ghl_location_id VARCHAR(20);

COMMENT ON COLUMN clients.ghl_api_key IS 'GoHighLevel Private Integration Token (PIT)';
COMMENT ON COLUMN clients.ghl_location_id IS 'GoHighLevel Location ID for MCP integration (20 characters)';
```

## To Access PostgreSQL on Render

1. Go to Render Dashboard
2. Select your PostgreSQL database
3. Click "Connect" â†’ Copy the PSQL Command
4. Run in terminal or use Render's Web Shell
5. Paste the SQL commands above

**THIS IS THE ONLY FIX NEEDED - The code is already deployed and handles missing columns gracefully, but the database NEEDS these columns to exist.**
