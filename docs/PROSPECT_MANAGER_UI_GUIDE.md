## FAQ

**Q: Can I leave the page open while it runs?**
A: Yes! The scheduler runs on the server. You can close the page and it will keep running. Open the page again to check status.

**Q: What happens if I refresh the page?**
A: Nothing bad! The page reloads and reconnects to the scheduler. If it was running, it will still show as running.

**Q: Can I start multiple schedulers?**
A: No. If you click "Start" while one is running, it will stop the old one and start a new one.

**Q: Will it automatically restart tomorrow?**
A: No. You must manually click "Start Scheduler" each day at 9am.

**Q: What if my computer goes to sleep?**
A: The scheduler runs on the server, not your computer. It will keep running even if your computer sleeps.

**Q: How do I know if it's working correctly?**
A: Check these signs:
- Status is green
- "Called Today" increases every 2 minutes
- Different phone numbers in Twilio dashboard
- Prospects change from "TO_BE_CALLED" to "CALLED" in the list
