## Daily Operation Schedule

### What Happens Automatically

**9:00 AM EST** - Scheduler can be started (business hours begin)

**Every 2 Minutes** - Makes one call to next prospect in queue

**4:59 PM EST** - Scheduler stops (business hours end, before 5 PM)

**After 200 Calls** - Scheduler auto-pauses for the day

### What You Need to Do

**Each Morning at 9 AM:**
```bash
curl -X POST https://ringlypro-crm.onrender.com/api/scheduled-caller/start \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"clientId": 15}'
```

**That's it!** The scheduler handles everything else.

---

## Configuration Settings

Current settings (in `src/services/scheduled-auto-caller.js`):

```javascript
config: {
  schedule: '*/2 9-17 * * 1-5',  // Every 2 minutes, 9am-5pm EST, Mon-Fri
  timezone: 'America/New_York',
  minInterval: 2,                 // minutes between calls
  maxCallsPerHour: 30,           // safety limit
  maxCallsPerDay: 200            // hard limit
}
```

### What This Means:

| Setting | Value | Meaning |
|---------|-------|---------|
| **Schedule** | `*/2 9-17 * * 1-5` | Every 2 minutes, 9am-4:59pm, Mon-Fri |
| **Timezone** | `America/New_York` | Eastern Time (EST/EDT) |
| **Max Calls/Day** | 200 | Hard stop after 200 calls |
| **Max Calls/Hour** | 30 | Safety limit (not usually hit) |
| **Call Interval** | 2 minutes | Time between calls |

---

## Monitoring & Troubleshooting

### Check How Many Calls Made Today

```sql
-- In database
SELECT
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE call_status = 'CALLED' AND DATE(last_called_at) = CURRENT_DATE) as called_today,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE call_status = 'TO_BE_CALLED') as remaining
FROM business_directory
WHERE client_id = 15;
```

### Check Server Logs

View live logs on Render dashboard:
```
https://dashboard.render.com
```

Look for:
- ‚úÖ `üöÄ Scheduled Auto-Caller started`
- ‚úÖ `üìû Calling prospect: [name] ([phone])`
- ‚úÖ `‚úÖ Call initiated: [callSid]`
- ‚ö†Ô∏è `‚ö†Ô∏è Daily call limit reached (200)`
- ‚è∞ `‚è∞ Outside business hours, skipping call`

### Common Issues

#### Issue: "Scheduler is already running"
**Solution:** Stop it first, then start:
```bash
curl -X POST https://ringlypro-crm.onrender.com/api/scheduled-caller/stop
curl -X POST https://ringlypro-crm.onrender.com/api/scheduled-caller/start \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"clientId": 15}'
```

#### Issue: "No prospects found with status TO_BE_CALLED"
**Solution:** Add prospects to the database first using Business Collector.

#### Issue: "Outside business hours"
**Solution:** Wait until 9 AM - 5 PM EST on a weekday (Mon-Fri).

#### Issue: Scheduler stopped unexpectedly
**Reasons:**
1. ‚úÖ Reached 200 calls for the day (normal)
2. ‚úÖ Ran out of prospects (normal)
3. ‚úÖ Hit 5 PM EST (normal)
4. ‚ùå Server restarted (need to manually restart scheduler)

## Call Status Workflow

### Database Status Values

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `TO_BE_CALLED` | Queued, not yet called |
| `CALLED` | Successfully called |
| `FAILED` | Call attempt failed |
| `SKIPPED` | Manually skipped |

### What Happens During a Call

1. **Fetch Next Prospect**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM business_directory
   WHERE call_status = 'TO_BE_CALLED' AND client_id = 15
   ORDER BY created_at ASC
   LIMIT 1
   ```

2. **Make Call via Twilio**
   - Rachel Premium Voice delivers voicemail
   - TCPA-compliant message played

3. **Update Database**
   ```sql
   UPDATE business_directory
   SET call_status = 'CALLED',
       call_attempts = call_attempts + 1,
       last_called_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
       call_result = 'voicemail'
   WHERE id = [prospect_id]
   ```

4. **Increment Counter**
   - `calledToday` increases by 1
   - Check if limit (200) reached
