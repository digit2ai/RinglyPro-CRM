🔁 How They Work

### 🧠 Strategic Blueprint

They begin with a deep dive into your business goals, audience, competitors, and positioning. This drives a custom strategy tailored to your market and growth objectives.

Before execution, they typically do:
- Audit of existing performance
- Audience and competitive research
- Goal alignment and KPI setup

This ensures campaigns are aligned with business outcomes rather than just outputs.

### 📌 Step-by-Step Workflow

**Discovery Call**
You book a call through the website to clarify goals and needs.

**Proposal & Strategy**
They draft a proposal with tailored services and deliverables.

**Onboarding**
You receive a welcome packet, brand questionnaire, and strategy outline.

**Elite Creative Production**
The team handles the entire creative lifecycle: concept, script, filming, and final edit. Content is engineered to fit the chosen platforms and audience psychology.

**Market Execution & Engagement**
Campaigns are launched across paid and organic channels. Focus is on turning viewers into active followers and customers.

**Campaign Execution & Optimization**
- Launching campaigns (ads, content, SEO)
- Tracking performance with analytics
- Regular optimization based on results
- Reporting to clients on ROI and growth metrics

**Data-Driven Optimization**
Analytics guide optimization in real time. Strategies are refined based on performance — not vanity metrics.

**Review & Revision**

**Ongoing Lead Generation**
The goal is consistent inbound leads and sales pipeline growth, especially for high-ticket and B2B clients.

This iterative approach helps refine strategies over time.

### 🕒 Timeline to Results

- Most services run on 6-month retainers to ensure consistent outcomes.

### 📬 Communication Flow

- Portal access for content approvals
- Email for major communication, and SMS/daily updates for quick check-ins
- Response times usually within 24 business hours (often same-day)
- LevelUp emphasizes communication and transparency — clients are informed and involved in decision making throughout the campaign lifecycle.

💰 Pricing & Engagement

### 📌 Pricing Structure

LevelUp does not publish fixed prices publicly — their costs depend on the scope, channels, and goals of the campaign. Costs depend on factors including:

- Scope of creative production (video, scriptwriting, photography)
- Paid media budgets (for ads management)
- Strategy and ongoing optimization support
- Industry and campaign complexity

Smaller local businesses can expect flexible options, while more aggressive, multi-channel programs will cost more due to increased strategy and media spending.

Typical engagement models include:
- Monthly retainers
- Media spend budgets (for paid ads)
- Custom proposals following discovery calls

**Contract Details**
- Most work is based on 6-month retainers for consistency and measurable results.
- Cancellation requires 30 days' written notice.

**Why No Standard Pricing?**
They build packages around content volume, filming needs, media spend, and add-ons like PR/website support, so pricing varies widely.
