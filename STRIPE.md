Option 1: Test Existing Code First (Recommended)

Verify your initiateReload() method works
Make a test API call to create a payment intent
Confirm it creates the payment_transactions record

Option 2: Build the Dashboard UI

Create the credits purchase modal
Add Stripe Elements for card payment
Wire up the 4 package buttons ($10, $20, $50, $100)

Option 3: Complete the Webhook Handler

Secure the webhook with signature verification
Complete the payment flow when Stripe confirms payment
