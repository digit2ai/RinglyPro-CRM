## Troubleshooting

```
Should return list of clients.

**If fails:** Render might still be deploying. Wait 1-2 minutes.

---

### Issue: Settings tab doesn't show CRM section
**Check:** Browser cache - do hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)

---

### Issue: MCP Copilot doesn't auto-connect
**Check:**
1. Did you save credentials in Settings first?
2. Check browser console (F12) for errors
3. Verify URL has `?client_id=15` parameter

**Manual test:**
```bash
curl https://ringlypro-crm.onrender.com/api/client/crm-credentials/15
```
Should show your credentials.

---

### Issue: "Not configured" after saving
**Check:** Database connection

```sql
SELECT ghl_api_key, ghl_location_id FROM clients WHERE id = 15;
```

Should show your saved credentials.
